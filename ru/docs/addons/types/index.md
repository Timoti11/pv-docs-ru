# Types of Add-ons

## Client

Client add-ons add new features to the client. You don't need to install client add-ons on the server.

A single file supports both Forge and Fabric.

::: info Installation
Add the add-on into the `~/mods` folder.
:::

## Universal

Add-ons marked as universal are server-side only.

You only need to install it on the server and the feature will work for all the players with Plasmo Voice.

*All* universal add-ons work on Spigot, Fabric and Forge.

*Some* can be also installed as Bungee or Velocity plugins.

::: info On Fabric or Forge
Add the add-on into the `~/mods` folder.
:::

::: info On Spigot, Bungee or Velocity
Add the add-on into the `~/plugins` folder.
:::

Note that you can install the add-on on Bungee or Velocity only if add-on description says you can.

## Other

Add-ons not marked as universal or client may work differently.

For example, they can be exclusive to a certain platform, or have different files of a different platform.

Read the add-on description to figure out how to install it and what platforms are supported.
